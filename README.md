# 4180 Project Summary

With the midtankâ€™s built-in system, we will implement a Raspberry Pi 0 to execute more functions. We will be able to communicate with the MIND Tank and control it using a mobile app through wifi. The camera will be on the front of the MIND Tank and send video feedback to our custom web page, while the chemical sensors on the sides will print the concentration of their corresponding gas next to the video feed. Also we are adding a Laser Temperature Sensor to detect human temperature, which will also be printed on the web page. RGB LED will indicate whether the chemical sensor is reading over a certain amount of concentration.
